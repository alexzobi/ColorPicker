# Color Picker #

This is a quick color picking project with very basic functionality. The library used to create the color picker is an adaptation of [react-native-wheel-color-picker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-wheel-color-picker). The original library has a few issues that, based on time constraints, forced me to instead duplicate the code and modify as necessary. Long term solution will probably be either a PR on the library, but more likely a fork in which some heavy refactoring for greater flexibility and performance will take place.

The project uses mostly typescript with the exception of the aforementioned module code which is written in JS.

[react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg) and [react-native-svg-transformer](https://github.com/kristerkari/react-native-svg-transformer) are used to add svgs to the project for liquid scaling, dynamic icons. Svgs used within the project can be found through [wiki commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

Enjoy!
